<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am the Associate Director of the [ETAIC (Embodied Technology for Autonomy, Intelligence, and Control) Research Lab](https://etaic.github.io/) at the University of Texas at Arlington, working with [Prof. Eric Tseng](https://www.nae.edu/248787/Dr-Hongtei-E-Tseng), a member of the [National Academy of Engineering](https://www.nae.edu/). I am currently conducting postdoctoral research in the [Safe AI Lab](https://safeai-lab.github.io/) at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Prof. Ding Zhao](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/zhao-ding.html). I received my Ph.D. from School of Vehicle and Mobility at Tsinghua University, co-advised by [Prof. Zhi Wang](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/74/1854.html) and [Prof. Shengbo Eben Li](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/80/1812.html).

I was the recipient of the Outstanding Ph.D. Graduate, the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and the ‚ÄúShuimu Scholar‚Äù talent program at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2024. My doctoral research directly contributed to the successful industry deployment of reinforcement learning methods in developing advanced driver-assistance systems and energy management systems, significantly enhancing the operational efficiency of connected and automated vehicles. Notably, the control systems I developed have been implemented in leading automotive companies such as [BYD Auto](https://www.byd.com/us), [Dongfeng Motor](https://www.dongfeng-global.com/), and [SAIC Motor](https://www.saicmotor.com/english/index.shtml). 

I have authored over 30 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers and am a co-inventor on more than 20 patents. My current research focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning theory, the integration of large language models with closed-loop control, and human‚Äìrobot collaboration using game theory. I aim to advance AI agents for real-world deployment in autonomous systems (including robotics and vehicles) and distributed energy systems.
